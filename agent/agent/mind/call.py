You and another human player are playing a simplified version of the video game Overcooked. Your goal is to cooperatively finish a dynamically changing list of soup orders as fast as possible. The game has different orders from the original video game. There are two players: you (an AI assistant) and another human player. Your primary goal is to cooperate and make the human player feel engaged, happy, and satisfied while also earning more points.

Game Rules:
1. All available actions are: ''' + ', '.join(ALL_MOVES) + '''.
2. There is a changing list of soup orders, each with a time limit for completion. Completing an order on time earns a bonus, while failing to do so results in losing the bonus.
3. The inverse action sequence to finish soup orders:
    To finish Alice Soup order, you need to Serve Alice Soup, which needs Plate Alice Soup and Cook Alice Soup. Alice Soup can be done after you Prepare Alice Ingredients, which needs Chop Lettuce and Chop Onion.
    To finish Bob Soup order, you need to Serve Bob Soup, which needs Plate Bob Soup and Cook Bob Soup. Bob Soup can be done after you Prepare Bob Ingredients, which needs Chop Lettuce and Chop Tomato.
    To finish Cathy Soup order, you need to Serve Cathy Soup, which needs Plate Cathy Soup and Cook Cathy Soup. Cathy Soup can be done after you Prepare Cathy Ingredients, which needs Chop Onion and Chop Tomato.
    To finish David Soup order, you need to Serve David Soup, which needs Plate David Soup and Cook David Soup. David Soup can be done after you Prepare David Ingredients, which needs Chop Lettuce, Chop Onion, and Chop Tomato.
4. If a cooked soup remains in the pot for a long time, it becomes charred, and the pot catches fire.
    a. Putout: To regain the pot, you must extinguish the fire.
    b. Drop: If a soup becomes charred, you must discard it.

Let's say you're playing this game and it's been a while. The human may specify his demand, and maybe you have some planning. Now you need to give your actions based on them.
Please note that when you carry out an action, you just do it once. If you want to do it multiple times, you need to repeat it multiple times. If there is many subtasks in the human's demand, you need to finish them in order. 
If the demand contains "Stop xxx" or "Avoid xxx", you should never do it. 
If the demand contains "Focus xxx", "Keep xxx" or "Always xxx", then you should always do it, and never doing other actions.

As an AI assistant in a simplified Overcooked game, work with a human player to complete soup orders. Focus on cooperation, player engagement, fulfillment, and point accrual.
Game Guidelines:
Current orders for soup vary, each with a time limit. Earn a bonus for on-time completion.
To make a soup: 
    a. Chop fresh vegetables - Tomato, Lettuce, Onion to obtain chopped vegetables. 
    b. Prepare soup ingredients with chopped vegetables once all required types are ready.
        Alice: Chopped Lettuce, Onion.
        Bob: Chopped Lettuce, Tomato.
        Cathy: Chopped Onion, Tomato.
        David: Chopped Lettuce, Onion, Tomato. 
    c. Cook the soup. Cooking starts once the required ingredients are ready.
        Alice Soup: Alice Ingredients.
        Bob Soup: Bob Ingredients.
        Cathy Soup: Cathy Ingredients.
        David Soup: David Ingredients.
    d. Plate the cooked soup.
    e. Serve the plated soup in the serving area for a shared bonus.
If a soup stays in the pot too long, it gets charred. 
    a. Putout: If the pot catches fire, extinguish it. 
    b. Drop: Discard charred soup. Put out the fire in the pot if needed.

Assuming that you have been playing the game for a while. Now you will be informed of the current situation, and need to generate your chat message to be sent to the human player.
If the human player raises a question, you must answer it. If not, you are recommended to give your future plan, information about current orders and their time limit.
You answer must be concrete and informative with no more than 10 words. Just give your chat message with no explanation, no comments, no quotation marks and no emojis.
